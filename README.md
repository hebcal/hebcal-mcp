# Hebcal Jewish holidays and Hebrew calednar Model Context Protocol (MCP) server

Hebcal (pronounced *HEEB-kal*, as in **Heb**rew **cal**endar) is a free Jewish calendar and holiday web site.

Our mission is to increase awareness of Jewish holidays and to help Jews to be observant of the mitzvot.

This repository is the MCP server equivalent of the powerful ~[custom Jewish calendar](https://www.hebcal.com/hebcal)~ tool that lets you generate a list of Jewish holidays for any year (past, present or future). 

Also available are a Hebrew ~[date converter](https://www.hebcal.com/converter)~, ~[Shabbat candle lighting times](https://www.hebcal.com/shabbat)~ and ~[Torah readings](https://www.hebcal.com/sedrot/)~ (both full *kriyah* and triennial system), and a page to look up ~[yahrzeits, birthdays and anniversaries](https://www.hebcal.com/yahrzeit)~.
